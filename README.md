# Data Engineering Capstone Project 

This is my capstone for the Data Engineering course. It is an example of my technical skills in pandas, python and streamlit and a demonstration of my understanding and ability to work with and manipulate data into an extract, load and transform pipeline. 

## Project Details and User Stories

I chose a UFO sighting dataset as I've always been intrigued by reports. The dataset can be found on kaggle thanks to user x. 

### User Stories

- [ ] I want to load the data from the source so I can clean, transform and visualise it to generate insights.
- [ ] I want to clean the data by removing nulls, standardising formats and dropping unnecessary columns using pandas so I can have a clean dataset to work with.
- [ ] I want to enrich the dataset by transforming the data into new information using aggregation, summarisation and feature generation so I can have an interesting dataset to generate insights from. 
- [ ] I want to load the enriched dataset into streamlit so I can create filters and visualisations such as bar charts and scatter plots in order to discover insights to share.
- [ ] I want to write unit tests for major functions that load, clean and transform the data so I can ensure my code is functional and consistent.


## Local Setup and Usage

- Clone or download the project from this Github
- Create and activate a Python virtual environment
- Install project dependencies from the requirements.txt
- To deploy the streamlit project locally use the 'streamlit run main.py' command.
- To run the tests use 'python -m unittest test_file_name.py'


## Process

### Setup



### Loading, Cleaning and Transforming the Data

### Filtering the data

### Creating Visualisations

### Writing and Running Tests

## Proposed Improvements

### Create more features

- Create a colour feature so I can analyse the colour of the UFOs
